Firstly, Created an ec2 instance in AWS and started the ec2.
Used Gitbash as ssh client and logged into the remote ec2 using key01.pem
commands used:
ssh -i key01.pem ec2-user@(public-ip)
cd
mkdir my_folder   				//creating a directory
cd my_folder     				//navigating into directory
touch my_file.txt 				// creating a file
vi my_file.txt 					//  open the file in vi editor
 1 press i key to start insert mode
 2 This is the content in my_file.txt
 3 press 'esc',:wq!(to save and exit the editor)
cat my_file.txt 				// see the contents in the file
touch another_file.txt
vi another_file.txt
cat another_file.txt
cat another_file.txt >> my_file.txt 		// '>>' to append another_file.txt content to my_file.txt
cat my_file.txt 				// verify content is appended or not
ls 						//to list all files and directories in the current directory


touch file{1..20}.txt                           //to create 20 .txt files
mv file1.txt file1.yml				//renaming the file to .yml
for i in {1..5}; do mv "file$i.txt" "file$i.yml";done       // to complete renaming in one go
ls -lt | head -6                                // to get top 5 files according to modification time
